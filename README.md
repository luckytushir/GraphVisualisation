# Graph Visualizer (gv)

A C++ application for interactive graph visualization and algorithm animation, built with SFML 3.0 and Dear ImGui.  
Supports multiple graph algorithms, custom graph input, and an integrated ML-based “best-algorithm” recommender.

## 🌟 Features

- **Graph Input**  
  - Adjacency matrix or adjacency list  
  - Up to 50 nodes  
- **Visual Display**  
  - Auto-layout of nodes  
  - Smooth, animated edges  
- **Algorithm Animations**  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)  
(for now)
- **Machine-Learning Recommender**  
  - Predicts the “best” algorithm based on graph density, connectivity, and size  
- **UI Controls (Dear ImGui)**  
  - Load / Save graph  
  - Step-through or autoplay animations  
  - Pause, resume, and reset  
  - Choose algorithm & view real-time status
